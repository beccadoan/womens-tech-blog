# Women's Tech Forum

## Description
Womenâ€™s Tech Forum is a website where women can share resources, support, and concerns through posts.

This application uses MYSQL, Sequelize, MYSQL2, Node.js, Express.js, Nodemailer, Handlebars, bcrypt, and dotenv.

## How to use
First, you will need to sign up with a username, email, and password. Then you can log in using your email and password. The homepage will be a feed with all posts, and when logged in you can create your own post and assign it a category, favorite someone else's post, or comment on someone else's post. You can also send the admin of Women's Tech Forum a message using the contact form, whose link is in the footer.
